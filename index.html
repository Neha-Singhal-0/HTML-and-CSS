        <h2>Web Applications</h2>
        <p>Web applications are highly dynamic and enable users to interact and complete tasks online, such as shopping, banking, or social networking. These applications are updated in real-time, often relying on user data to personalize experiences.</p>
        <p>They are designed with scalability in mind, allowing for increased traffic and data handling. Web applications usually require a server-side component to process data, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.</p>

      <div class="column right">
        <h2>Static Applications</h2>
        <p>Static applications are simpler in structure and provide pre-defined content without frequent updates. These applications are ideal for displaying information quickly and efficiently, often used for portfolios or informational websites.</p>
        <p>They load faster due to their fixed content and minimal server interactions, making them a great choice for sites where content does not need to change dynamically. Static applications are easier to develop and deploy than web applications.</p>
